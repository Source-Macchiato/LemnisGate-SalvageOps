# Lemnis Gate: Salvage Ops
# Unfinished, check back later
Lemnis Gate has been [discontinued since the April 11 2023](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/950180/view/3678916525459103536), with the developers stating that the PC players will be completely unable to play.  
I'd like to respectfully disagree.  
**The cycle must continue.**

---

**Salvage Ops** is a mod set designed to bring the game back to a functional state and provide access to unreleased WIP content.  
Current scope is:  
- Allow **Peer-to-Peer multiplayer** through *Steam* and *LAN*, featuring *spectator* role
- Unlock **63 playable map** prototypes with **2 unreleased play** modes. (All of them is pretty early in the prototype stages)
- Unlock beta-only "Chameleon company" customization tree for every character
- Make it **playable on Linux** (by disabling EAC)

## Installation
**NOTE:**  If you **and** the people you want to play with own the game on **Steam**, installing the mod is **optional**.  
You can just *change one text file* to unlock Steam P2P and WIP content. [**Refer to this guide**](/EASY_P2P.md).

- Locate the game folder. For *Steam*, you can do that by right-clicking the game in your library, open `Installed Files` tab and click `Browse...` button
- (Optional) If there is an `EasyAntiCheat` folder, uninstall it. Open the `EasyAntiCheat` folder, launch `EasyAntiCheat_Setup.exe`, click the `Uninstall` button in the left bottom corner in the EAC window, close the window, delete the `EasyAntiCheat` folder
- Download [`SalvageOps.zip` from the Releases tab](https://github.com/wafflecomposite/LemnisGateSalvageOps/releases/download/1.0/SalvageOps.zip)
- Move the contents of the archive to the folder of game (the root one that contains `LemnisGate.exe`), agreeing to replace the files

## Usage
# TODO

## Known issues
- `EasyAntiCheat client integrity error` in main menu. (Just press `Ok`)
- Modded game may open Frontier's issue tracker page in your default browser after the P2P match (you can just close it)
