# Lemnis Gate: Salvage Ops
# Unfinished, check back later
Lemnis Gate has been [discontinued since the April 11 2023](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/950180/view/3678916525459103536), with the developers stating that the PC players will be completely unable to play.  
I'd like to respectfully disagree.  
**The cycle must continue.**

---

**Salvage Ops** is a mod set designed to bring the game back to a functional state and provide access to unreleased WIP content.  
Current scope is:  
- Allow **Peer-to-Peer multiplayer** through *Steam* and *LAN*, featuring *spectator* role
- Unlock **63 playable map** prototypes with **2 unreleased play** modes. (All of them is pretty early in the prototype stages)
- Unlock beta-only "Chameleon company" customization tree for every character
- Make it **playable on Linux** (by disabling EAC)

## Installation
**NOTE:**  If you and the people you want to play with own the game on Steam, installing the mod is optional.  
You can just *change one text file* to unlock Steam P2P and WIP content. [Refer to this guide](/EASY_P2P.md).
