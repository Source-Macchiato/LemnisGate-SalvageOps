# Lemnis Gate: Salvage Ops

Lemnis Gate has been [discontinued since the April 11 2023](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/950180/view/3678916525459103536), with the developers stating that the PC players will be completely unable to play.  
I'd like to respectfully disagree.  
**The cycle must continue.**

**Salvage Ops** is a mod set designed to bring the game back to a functional state and provide access to unreleased WIP content.  
Current scope is:  
- Allow **Peer-to-Peer multiplayer** through *Steam* and *LAN*, featuring *spectator* role
- Unlock **63 playable map** prototypes with **2 unreleased play** modes. (All of them is pretty early in the prototype stages)
- Unlock beta-only "Chameleon company" customization tree for every character
- Make it **playable on Linux** (by disabling EAC)

## Installation
**Work in progress, check back later**

## Known issues
- Modded game may occasionally open Frontier's issue tracker page in your default browser after the match (you can just close it)
